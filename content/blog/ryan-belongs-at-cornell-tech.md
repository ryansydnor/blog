On my eighteenth birthday I revved up my father’s motorcycle for the first time. I took off and the ride evoked an unparalleled feeling of freedom. With funds I had saved from my high school web design and computer repair businesses, I bought myself a used Suzuki GS500. For the next five years, my father, an entrepreneur, and I spent our weekends traveling across the Northeast and making memories.

One fateful evening, I crashed. If it were not for the skillful surgeon in the emergency room, my foot would have been amputated. Instead, I had several more extensive surgeries and was non-weight bearing and virtually bedridden for over six months.

This near-death experience was my wake up call. I realized that I was not yet maximizing my potential and that I needed to focus if I wanted to accomplish my ultimate career goal: becoming the CEO of my own technology company.

The accident happened shortly after I graduated from college, during my fourth month working as a Technology Analyst for Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML). My manager told me that I could take disability leave but, instead, I asked him to send me a secure laptop to enable me to work remotely. Though I was bedridden, I resolved to devote myself to both my recovery and work. Determined to overcome the surgeon’s uncertainty about my ability to walk normally again, I went to physical therapy four times a week. While rebuilding my strength, I simultaneously taught myself the tools, languages, and frameworks necessary to create and deliver GIRT, a tool that allowed Financial Advisors at BAML to extract and analyze historical alternative investments’ trade data. My dual focus on both my recovery and career worked. I vividly remember walking into my Director’s office to receive my promotion to Assistant Vice President in half the time it normally takes a Technology Analyst.

As I led a team to extend GIRT to access data from the entire Global Wealth and Investment Management organization, I thought back to my wake up call. Although I was learning about web technologies and project management, the size and bureaucracy of BAML was inhibiting my potential to grow my career towards my goal of founding a technology company. While injured, I had read The Principles by Ray Dalio, in which he outlines his approach to running Bridgewater Associates (BW), the world’s largest hedge fund. I was captivated but skeptical about the culture Ray had created and I wanted to experience it first hand. I applied to and was hired by BW’s Core Technology department. I was excited that I assimilated into the company’s radically transparent, results-oriented culture outlined in The Principles, which was so different from BAML’s culture.

I became curious: what were the attributes that comprised a BW culture fit? I began exploring this question on nights and weekends. I utilized employee data to create Unicorn Hunt, an application that allowed BW’s recruiters to target sources of candidates based on attributes that lead to success at BW. Within 10 minutes of sharing my prototype, the Head of Recruiting called me. As I walked towards his office, I saw Unicorn Hunt open on every recruiting analyst’s screen.

*Due to BW’s IP considerations, I cannot include a screenshot of Unicorn Hunt. Instead, I included a screenshot of my project that maps out breweries in NYC, [brewery.life](https://brewery.life), which is inspired by Unicorn Hunt’s real time filtering functionality.*

Unicorn Hunt sparked a paradigm shift in the way BW's recruiters targeted universities, eventually doubling the throughput of BW’s campus hiring pipeline. The initiative I showed in creating an innovative, out-of-the-box solution on my own time earned me a promotion into BW’s new and exclusive technology department, Cloud Enablement (CE). I was excited to expand my technical breadth by collaborating with the firm’s most elite technologists by working on cutting edge cloud technologies and open source software (OSS).

A year later, I was leading a CE team to help the firm migrate out of its private data centers and into the cloud serviced by Amazon Web Services (AWS). I realized that the more AWS accounts I had, the more burdensome switching between them became. I brainstormed a solution with my team: leverage an OSS product by another company, [Adroll](https://github.com/AdRoll/hologram). I formed a strategic partnership with Adroll and executed on our idea: a browser extension named [Holochrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/holochrome/fgnplojdffjfbcmoldcfdoikldnogjpa). 

Initially, Holochrome supported switching between AWS accounts with a few mouse clicks; however, technologists outside of our team did not use it. I recognized that, while Holochrome alleviated some burden, it still required effort. I reduced the interaction to a single keystroke. Within a day, every BW technologist was using Holochrome. I then worked with a designer to create sleek iconography and distributed it via Holochrome’s auto-update feature. I was inundated with positive feedback and realized technologists outside of BW could benefit from Holochrome. I collaborated with my manager and published my first OSS product. Through successful marketing via Reddit, HackerNews, and a presentation at AWS’ Loft in San Francisco, I helped Holochrome acquire its first thousand users. That experience helped me realize that I love creating products from scratch.

When I first started at Teachers Pay Teachers (TpT), the world’s largest marketplace where teachers buy and sell educational materials, I discovered opportunities for improvements to core products, foundational technologies, organizational designs and developmental processes. Within my first few months, I built a small team around myself utilizing tools to [drive process efficiency improvements](/blog/how-teachers-pay-teachers-uses-jira-on-product-teams/), delivered a minimum viable [streaming video product](/blog/streaming-video-infrastructure-on-tpt-using-evaporatejs-verk-aws-php-kaltura/), and improved foundational technology by [migrating unstable, legacy infrastructure onto more reliable infrastructure](/blog/challenges-faced-while-scaling-to-serve-millions-of-views-per-day/).

I’ve continued scaling the breadth of my ownership at TpT and am currently the Technical Lead of an international team of 10 managing an ever-growing product catalog. Through my evolution, driven by proactive ownership from individual contributor to Technical Lead, I have realized that to continue scaling my ownership, I must have a stronger grasp over core business concepts that are the underpinnings of the product, technical, and organizational decisions I make every day.

Throughout my career, I’ve progressed through a funnel of increasing responsibility at increasingly product driven organizations. I believe that the next phase of this funnel is my position as the CTO of a product focused start-up. The culmination of this funnel is my position as the CEO of a tightly knit, mission driven organization. My experience thus far has netted a plethora of invaluable skills to understand how to build successful teams and products. However, and perhaps more importantly, it has helped me realize that determining what to build is even more valuable.

In order to bridge the gap between my skills and my goals, I need a deeper understanding of both business and product fundamentals. This will enable me to become a thought leader, capable of balancing the complex and multivariate equations that are inherent to building product focused companies from scratch. When I was on campus in the Bloomberg Center, I envisioned myself successfully navigating these questions in Studio. I aim to begin building a startup during Studio, seek advice from the Spinout Clinic, meet future investors in the Spinout Open House, win a Spinout Award upon graduation, and eventually receive funding from the Big Red Venture Fund to support me in building NYC’s next unicorn.
