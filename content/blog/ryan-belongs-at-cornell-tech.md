When I was in the 3rd grade, I was assigned a project to collect postmarks from all 50 states. Most kids wrote to friends or family and collected a handful of postmarks. I had seen my mother write to investor relations contacts at companies and they always replied. Always. So, I wrote to 50 companies in 50 states. Upon seeing the box of 50 returns, the teacher declared that no class had ever collected all 50, especially not through one student. This was my first time taking ownership over a problem, thinking outside the box, and delivering results.

I carried this ownership mentality through my highschool years where I founded a number of small businesses. One business I started was snow shoveling. It failed. I learned that despite my best (and sweaty) efforts, I could not compete with a professional snow removal company’s scale and efficiency. I refocused my efforts on businesses where I could differentiate myself. I had always loved tinkering with computers, so pursued two simultaneous businesses based on my pre existing skills: computer repair and web design. Within a few months, I had a steady stream of inbound clients. The next winter, rather than shovel snow, I was able to buy myself a snowboard and go riding. While on the slopes I realized that my failing and reflecting, while painful, had been instrumental to becoming a successful owner.

*After a few winters of snowboarding instead of shoveling, I got pretty good!*


The feeling of freedom I always felt while snowboarding was amplified when I turned 18 and started up my father’s motorcycle for the first time. With funds from my businesses saved up, I bought myself a worn-down Suzuki GS500. For the next five years, my father and I would spend our weekends touring across the northeast and our weeknights researching routes to new destinations and working on our bikes.

One Friday evening, I was testing a new front tire in preparation for a planned weekend getaway to Vermont when I made a mistake. At 50 miles per hour, my front tire slipped, the bike went out of control and it came crashing down on my right foot. The doctor’s diagnosis was a Lisfranc fracture where all five of my right metatarsals were both fractured and dislocated. If it were not for the skillful surgeon in the emergency room, my foot would have been amputated; instead I was non-weight bearing for six months.

It was only my fourth month working at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and I was sure they’d fire me once I told them about my inability to come to the office for six months. So, I asked them to send me a laptop to enable me to work remotely more effectively. The flexibility of remote work allowed me to expedite my recovery by frequently attending painful sessions with my physical therapist where we codified the mantra of my recovery: no excuses, just results. I internalized and applied this mantra in both my physical recovery and my work. I taught myself the tools, languages, and frameworks necessary to excel. By the time I returned to the office, I was widely considered the best front-end engineer in the Alternative Investments department. I hobbled on crutches into my Director’s office to receive my promotion to Assistant Vice President in half the time it normally takes a new graduate. This experience further reinforced that if you take ownership over a situation, there is always an opportunity to excel.

While injured, I read ‘The Principles’ by Ray Dalio, where he encouraged employees at his hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates (BW), to give constructive criticism through the lens of radical transparency. At BW criticism is viewed as a way to inflict pain which is a catalyst for progress. In fact, its offices have the following equation adorning their walls: “Pain + Reflection = Progress”. I became intrigued with the culture, applied, and was hired to BW’s Core Technology department. I learned that BW has a formulaic approach to remediating problems: bad outcomes are addressed in unemotional, objective diagnosis sessions that unearth root causes resulting in action items of the form ‘who should do what differently?’

About six months into my tenure at BW I was in the middle of a heated diagnosis. I looked across the table and saw my manager, Geoff’s, eyes welling up. A room full of his direct reports, peers, and management was discussing a factual timeline of events that had occurred over the prior six months. At a certain point Geoff lost his composure, began crying, and had to step out. He was subsequently “sorted” from his role and let go from the firm. I never wanted to experience the fallout associated with a culture mismatch again.

I wanted to understand why some people at BW thrived and accelerated their growth via diagnosis sessions while others struggled. I wanted to understand how BW was capable of finding people who were courageous enough to stare, along with a group of spectators, their fears and failures in the face. I wanted to understand the attributes that comprised a BW culture fit. My curiosity got the better of me so I began exploring the question on nights and weekends. BW’s principle of radical transparency meant all employee data was available to me. I utilized this data to create Unicorn Hunt, an application that allowed BW’s recruiters to target sources of candidates based on a number of dimensions that were unique to success at BW. Within 10 minutes of e-mailing a prototype to my colleagues in Recruiting, the Head of Recruiting called me to come to his office. As I walked towards his office, I saw Unicorn Hunt open on every recruiting analyst’s screen. Unicorn Hunt increased the probability of hiring a BW culture fit and decreased the probability that others would have diagnosis sessions that were counterproductive. This experience taught me that one of the most important decisions an owner can make is the culture they create and how the people they hire enhance that culture.

*Due to BW’s IP considerations, I cannot include a screenshot of Unicorn Hunt. Instead, I included a screenshot of my project that maps out breweries in NYC, [brewery.life](https://brewery.life), which is inspired by Unicorn Hunt’s real time filtering functionality.*

Some of my subsequent projects at BW involved contributions to open source software to help the firm migrate out of its private data centers and into the cloud serviced by Amazon Web Services (AWS). I helped automate the creation and configuration of cloud resources through a variety of existing projects, such as [Ansible and BuildBot](/#projects), This automation unlocked a tremendous amount of time for BW’s IT employees. The open source community also informed me through Gitub that it was able to save time. I was exhilarated that so many people found my work helpful. As my contributions to open source software grew, hundreds of thousands of people used my software to save time on their projects.
During this time, I saw an opportunity. I realized that the more AWS accounts I had, the more burdensome switching between them became. Managing credentials and manually logging out and back in was a chore. So, I designed a browser extension, [Holochrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/holochrome/fgnplojdffjfbcmoldcfdoikldnogjpa), which could switch between AWS accounts with a single keystroke. Within a few days, all software engineers in BW were saving time by using Holochrome. I published both my and [BW’s first open source project](https://github.com/Bridgewater/Holochrome). Through successful marketing via Reddit, HackerNews, and a presentation at the AWS Pop-Up Loft in San Francisco, I helped Holochrome acquire its first thousand users. Creating this end-to-end, innovative solution, albeit a small feat, felt incredible. I sought an opportunity where I could make building products my full-time focus.

When I first started at Teachers Pay Teachers (TpT), the world’s largest marketplace where teachers buy and sell educational materials, the engineering team had just grown to 30 people and was struggling to evolve with its rapid growth. In addition to opportunities to improve TpT’s product, I discovered opportunities to improve foundational technology, organizational design and developmental processes. Within a few months, I had delivered a [minimum viable streaming video product](/blog/streaming-video-infrastructure-on-tpt-using-evaporatejs-verk-aws-php-kaltura/). While delivering the product I improved foundational technology by [migrating unstable, legacy infrastructure onto more reliable infrastructure](/blog/challenges-faced-while-scaling-to-serve-millions-of-views-per-day/). I simultaneously built a small team around myself utilizing tools like [JIRA to drive process efficiency improvements](/blog/how-teachers-pay-teachers-uses-jira-on-product-teams/). I’ve continued scaling the breadth of my ownership at TpT and am currently the Technical Lead of an international team of 10 responsible for an ever-growing product catalog. Through my evolution, driven by proactive ownership from individual contributor to Technical Lead, I have realized that in order to continue scaling my ownership I need to have a stronger grasp over core business concepts that are the underpinnings of the product, technical, and organizational decisions I make every day.

Throughout my career, I’ve progressed through a funnel of increasing responsibility at increasingly product driven organizations. I believe that the next phase of this funnel is my position as the CTO of a product focused start-up. The culmination of this funnel is my position as the CEO of a tightly knit, mission driven organization. My experience thus far has netted a plethora of invaluable skills to aide in the understanding of how to build successful teams and products. However, and perhaps more importantly, it has helped me realize that determining what to build is even more valuable.

In order to bridge the gap between my skills and my goals, I need a deeper understanding of both business and product fundamentals. This will enable me to become a thought leader, capable of balancing the complex and multivariate equations that are inherent to building product focused companies from scratch. Cornell Tech’s core curriculum supplemented with it’s practical, hands on Studio will prepare me to successfully navigate these equations. I aim to begin building a startup during Studio, seek advice from the Spinout Clinic, meet future investors in the Spinout Open House, win a Spinout Award upon graduation, and eventually receive funding from the Big Red Venture Fund to support me in building NYC’s next unicorn.
