In 3rd grade, I was assigned a project to collect postmarks from all 50 states. Most kids wrote to friends or family and collected a handful of postmarks. I had seen my mother write to investor relations contacts at companies and they always replied. Always. So, I wrote to 50 companies in 50 states. Upon seeing the box of 50 returns, the teacher declared that no class had ever collected all 50, especially not through one student. This was my first time taking ownership over a problem, thinking outside the box, and delivering results.

*I should have taken better ownership over my hair style!*

I carried this ownership mentality through my highschool years where I founded a number of small businesses. One business I started was snow shoveling. It failed. I learned that despite my best (and sweaty) efforts, I could not compete with a professional snow removal company’s scale and efficiency. I refocused my efforts on businesses where I could differentiate myself. My father, an electrical engineer, instilled a passion for computers in me. I pursued two simultaneous businesses based on my existing skillset: computer repair and web design. Within a few months, I had a steady stream of inbound clients. 

When I turned 18, my father allowed me to try out his motorcycle. I was hooked. With funds from my businesses saved up, I bought myself a worn-down Suzuki GS500. For the next five years, my father and I would spend our weekends touring across the northeast.

One fateful evening, I crashed. I had a Lisfranc fracture. If it were not for the skillful surgeon in the emergency room, my foot would have been amputated; instead, I was non-weight bearing for six months.

*Before and after surgery.*

I expedited my recovery through sessions with a physical therapist where we codified the mantra of my recovery: no excuses, just results. I internalized this mantra to both my physical recovery and work. By the time I could walk again, I was the best front-end engineer in my department at Bank of America. I hobbled on crutches into my Director’s office to receive my promotion to Assistant Vice President in half the time it typically did. This experience further reinforced to me that if I take ownership over a situation, there are always opportunities to excel.

While injured, I read ‘The Principles’ by Ray Dalio, where he encouraged employees at his hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates (BW), to give one another constructive criticism. At BW, criticism is viewed as a way to inflict pain which is a catalyst for progress. In fact, its offices have “Pain + Reflection = Progress” adorning their walls. I became intrigued with the culture, applied, and was hired to BW’s Core Technology department. I quickly learned that while some people were able to embrace Ray’s principles and accelerate their career trajectories, others were unable to overcome the pain.

I was curious to understand the personal attributes that comprised a BW culture fit and began exploring the question on nights and weekends. I utilized BW’s historical employee data to create Unicorn Hunt, an application that allowed BW’s recruiters to target sources of candidates based on a number of dimensions that were unique to success at BW. Within 10 minutes of e-mailing a prototype to my colleagues in Recruiting, the Head of Recruiting called me. As I walked towards his office, I saw Unicorn Hunt on every recruiting analyst’s screen. Unicorn Hunt successfully increased the probability of hiring a BW culture fit. My time at BW taught me that some of the most important decisions an owner can make are the culture they create and who they hire to enhance that culture.

*Due to BW’s IP considerations, I cannot include a screenshot of Unicorn Hunt. Instead, I included a screenshot of my project that maps out breweries in NYC, [brewery.life](https://brewery.life), which is inspired by Unicorn Hunt’s real time filtering functionality.*

At BW, I also contributed to open source software to help the firm migrate out of its private data centers and into the cloud serviced by Amazon Web Services (AWS). I automated the creation and configuration of cloud resources through a variety of existing projects, such as [Ansible and BuildBot](/#projects). This automation unlocked a tremendous amount of time for both BW’s IT employees and the open source community. I was exhilarated that as my contributions grew, I helped hundreds of thousands of people save time.

My team and I realized that the more AWS accounts we had, the more burdensome switching between them became. I brainstormed with my team, collaborated with the creators of [hologram, AdRoll](https://github.com/AdRoll/hologram), and developed a browser extension, [Holochrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/holochrome/fgnplojdffjfbcmoldcfdoikldnogjpa). Holochrome enabled secure switching between AWS accounts with a single keystroke. Within a few days, BW software engineers who interfaced with AWS were saving time by using Holochrome. With tremendous support from my management chain, I published my first and [BW’s second open source project](https://github.com/Bridgewater/Holochrome). Through successful marketing via Reddit, HackerNews, and a presentation at the AWS Pop-Up Loft in San Francisco, I helped Holochrome acquire its first thousand users. Creating this end-to-end, innovative solution felt incredible. It inspired me to seek an opportunity where I could make building products my full-time focus.

When I first started at Teachers Pay Teachers (TpT), the world’s largest marketplace where teachers buy and sell educational materials, I discovered opportunities for improvements to core products, foundational technologies, organizational designs and developmental processes. Within my first few months, I built a small team around myself utilizing tools to [drive process efficiency improvements](/blog/how-teachers-pay-teachers-uses-jira-on-product-teams/), delivered a minimum viable [streaming video product](/blog/streaming-video-infrastructure-on-tpt-using-evaporatejs-verk-aws-php-kaltura/), and improved foundational technology by [migrating unstable, legacy infrastructure onto more reliable infrastructure](/blog/challenges-faced-while-scaling-to-serve-millions-of-views-per-day/).

I’ve continued scaling the breadth of my ownership at TpT and am currently the Technical Lead of an international team of 10 managing an ever-growing product catalog. Through my evolution, driven by proactive ownership from individual contributor to Technical Lead, I have realized that to continue scaling my ownership, I must have a stronger grasp over core business concepts that are the underpinnings of the product, technical, and organizational decisions I make every day.

Throughout my career, I’ve progressed through a funnel of increasing responsibility at increasingly product driven organizations. I believe that the next phase of this funnel is my position as the CTO of a product focused start-up. The culmination of this funnel is my position as the CEO of a tightly knit, mission driven organization. My experience thus far has netted a plethora of invaluable skills to understand how to build successful teams and products. However, and perhaps more importantly, it has helped me realize that determining what to build is even more valuable.

In order to bridge the gap between my skills and my goals, I need a deeper understanding of both business and product fundamentals. This will enable me to become a thought leader, capable of balancing the complex and multivariate equations that are inherent to building product focused companies from scratch. When I was on campus in the Bloomberg Center, I envisioned myself successfully navigating these questions in Studio. I aim to begin building a startup during Studio, seek advice from the Spinout Clinic, meet future investors in the Spinout Open House, win a Spinout Award upon graduation, and eventually receive funding from the Big Red Venture Fund to support me in building NYC’s next unicorn.
