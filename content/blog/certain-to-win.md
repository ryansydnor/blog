Certain to Win dissects historical warfare strategies through the lens of his [OODA Loop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) and derives principles that can be applied to business. The premise of applying warfare to a business setting is that business is a zero sum game played by a “team” in stressful and uncertain situations. Here are they ke concepts:

# Time

Boyd argues that time is the most effective weapon in your arsenal. Whichever side is able to out maneuver its competition will be victorious, regardless of conventional “firepower” metrics. Optimizing for time requires decentralized decision making. If all decisions share similar conduits, bottlenecks will form. If the people closest to the decision to be made are empowered to do the right thing, you gain speed. The definition of “right” requires a strong vision and mutual trust. Boyd referred to the ability to do this well as...

# Agility

Conventionally, agility is defined as the ability to move or think quickly. A key premise in Boyd’s definition of agility, however, is the ability to move or think quickly without becoming disoriented. Agility becomes increasingly important at the trailing edge of strategy. Strategies are based on inevitably fallible models of the world which can never capture every unpredictable detail. If you are unable to react to new sources of information and modify your strategy accordingly, you are doomed to fail. So how do you create agility?

# Culture

Boyd argues that to create agility you first need to build a strong culture. Culture starts with people. Sophisticated hardware is worthless if it’s not being deployed properly. Ideas are worthless if they’re not actionable. Here are the fundamental building blocks of culture, demonstrated via the WW2 German military. 

### Fingerspitzengefuhl 

Intuitive knowledge or skill, especially for complex and chaotic situations. Comes from incessant practice in first rote then increasingly complex and challenging situations.

*Individuals with intuitive knowledge or skill.*


### Einheit 

Mutual trust, unity, and cohesion. This can be built through mutual experience.

*A cohesive, aligned group of individuals with intuitive knowledge or skill.*


### Schwerpunkt

Any concept that provides focus and direction. This should be directional and not specific. It should provide actionable guidance in ambiguous situations. It should focus on the change your group wants to see in the world (outward), not on the group itself (inward). This is not a plan, just the overarching direction you want your plans to take.

*Schwerpunkt aims the organization.*

### Auftragstaktik

This gives everyone in the organization a mission. It is the contract of leadership. It fosters responsibility at every level of the organization through a contractual agreement that focuses on “what” rather than “how”.

*Auftragstaktik provides the power.*


This culture encourages people to take initiative and act even during the periods chaos or uncertainty. Once this culture is in place, communication becomes implicit rather than explicit. There is no need for detailed, written instruction. This allows the entire organization think quickly without becoming disoriented. 

When people are thinking quickly, they’ll act more quickly. Boyd encourages people to take asymmetric fast transient actions. They can be defined as an action taken in response to the environment with the intent to surprise the competition. Asymmetric fast transients are the premise of Muhammad Ali’s slogan, “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.” When executed properly, these actions are able to inflict damage without taking any in return. Boyd encourages these asymmetric fast transients to happen more frequently and quickly using...

# OODA Loops

Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. These verbs compose Boyd’s best known framework. OODA loops encourage you to observe mismatches between your conception of the way the world should be and the way it really is, reorient yourself, brainstorm ideas, and execute them. The execution of your idea modifies your environment, which triggers an observation causing the loop to initiative. One caveat with the loop is that once fingerspitzengefuhl exists, the decide phase of the loop becomes intuitive and nearly instantaneous.

When executed more quickly than your competition you can uncover, create and exploit vulnerabilities and weakness (think: moving twice in a game of chess for every move your opponent takes). Accomplishing this level of exploitation continuously will inevitably lead to uncertainty, confusion, and disorder in your competition - eroding their einheit. These continued successes will do the exact opposite for your team and you will become stronger as a result. 

# Now What?

The book concludes by stating there’s no formula for success, but summarizes succinctly into a few bullet points:

- Understand maneuver warfare. (ex. Toyota Production System)
- Promote leaders who embrace this, remove ones who do not.
- Spread knowledge actively across your organization.
- Transcend boundaries. Do not simply do the same thing faster.
